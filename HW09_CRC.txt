HW 09 CRC 

Data Repository Assigment Summary
- hard code the path to the data files 
- read data from a Students, Instructors and Grades file using file_reading_gen from HW08
- Store data in data structures or classes 
- Generate warnings if input file DNE or is incorrectly formatted 
- Use Pretty Table to generate a summary table for Students including: CWID, Name, Sorted list of courses taken from grades.txt
- Use Pretty Table to generate a summary table for Instructors including: CWID, Name, Courses taught, and the number of students in each class 
- Use the CWID as dictionary keys since it is unique! 

Class: Repository 

Data structure to hold the students, instructors and grades 

	- Function: read the grades file (Student CWID, Course, Grade, Instr CWID) using file_reading_gen from HW08 (line by line or store in a list)
		- update the courses taken by each student, the courses taught by each instructor, and the number of students per course

	- Function: read the students file using file_reading_gen from HW08 (line by line or store in a list)
		- update the student instance with their information from the file (CWID, Name, Major)

	- Function: read the instructors file using file_reading_gen from HW08 (line by line or store in a list)
		- update the instructor instance with their information from the file (CWID, Name, Dept)

	- Function: Use Pretty Table to generate a summary table for Students including: CWID, Name, Sorted list of courses taken from grades.txt

	- Function: Use Pretty Table to generate a summary table for Instructors including: CWID, Name, Courses taught, and the number of students in each class

Class: Student 
	- holds all details for each instance of a student: CWID, Name, Major, Courses Taken (see next bullet)
		- use a defaultdict(str) to store the courses taken and the grade (key=course, value=grade)

Class: Instructor
	- holds all details for each instance of an instructor: CWID, Name, Dept, Courses Taught (see next bullet)
		- use a defaultdict(int) to store the courses taught and the number of students in each class (key=course, value=num of students)

Function: Main 
Run the project: 
	- Take a path to a directory to feed to the Class Repository()
	- Read the 3 files using the functions listed
