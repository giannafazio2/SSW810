SSW810 School Data Repository

HW09 is the first iteration of a university data repository. 
It reads an instructors, students and grades file in order to make summary tables about each student and instructor, and the courses that they are in.
Update the path to the data files (Repository) and the arguments for the file reader in order to run your own files.
